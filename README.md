# Script-no-psswrd
Hello!! This is my first repository on GitHub, it is a Bash script to change the Windows special keys file by CMD to be able to access a Windows computer without having the password, for this you need to enter a Linux OS and from there execute the script. You will need to mount the Windows drive on Linux and then follow the steps in the script menu (mounting is also done by the script). The Linux OS will start from the BIOS and when everything is done you will have to restart Windows from the BIOS, then when you want to access a user you will press the SHIFT key 5 times and the CMD will be displayed instead of the special keys. Once inside the CMD you will write "control userpasswords2" to access the user control panel and from there you will change the password. This script is made for ethical purposes and in case you forget the password of your Windows PC.
